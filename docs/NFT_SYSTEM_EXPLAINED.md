# GridNFT System - Non-Technical Explanation

## What are NFTs?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital certificates of ownership stored on a blockchain. Unlike regular tokens (fungible) where 1 AIPG = 1 AIPG, each NFT is one-of-a-kind with its own identity and properties.

Think of it like this:
- **Fungible Token (AIPG)**: Like dollar bills - any $1 bill is the same as another
- **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**: Like concert tickets - each has a unique seat number and can't be swapped 1:1

## AIPG GridNFT Overview

GridNFTs represent **ownership of AI worker nodes** in the AIPG network. Each NFT is a digital representation of a specific AI compute worker with its own:

- Unique ID number
- Performance statistics
- Visual artwork (image)
- Metadata (technical specs)
- Ownership history

## How GridNFTs are Constructed

### 1. On-Chain Component (Smart Contract)

The `GridNFT.sol` contract is deployed on the Base blockchain and handles:

#### Token Minting
- Each NFT is assigned a unique `tokenId` (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
- Only authorized minters can create new NFTs
- Each mint records: owner address, timestamp, initial metadata

#### Ownership Tracking
- Blockchain tracks who owns which NFT
- Owners can transfer NFTs to others
- Transfer history is permanently recorded
- Standard ERC721 compatibility (works with all NFT platforms)

#### Metadata Pointer
- Each NFT has a `tokenURI` - a link to its full data
- Format: `baseURI + tokenId + .json`
- Example: `https://nft.aipowergrid.io/metadata/123.json`

### 2. Off-Chain Component (Metadata & Images)

Each NFT's full information is stored in a JSON file hosted off-chain:

#### Metadata Structure (JSON)
```json
{
  "name": "AIPG Worker #123",
  "description": "High-performance AI compute node in the AIPG network",
  "image": "https://nft.aipowergrid.io/images/123.png",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "GPU Type",
      "value": "NVIDIA RTX 4090"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Compute Power",
      "value": "82.58 TFLOPS"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Uptime",
      "value": "99.8%"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Location",
      "value": "North America"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Join Date",
      "value": "2024-01-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visual Artwork (Image)
- Each NFT has a unique generated image
- Images are created by combining:
  - Base template
  - Worker-specific traits (GPU type, location, tier)
  - Performance indicators (color-coded for quality)
  - Unique ID overlays

### 3. Dynamic NFTs (Future Feature)

GridNFTs can be **dynamic** - their metadata updates based on real-world performance:

#### What Can Change
- Uptime percentage (tracked by sentry)
- Total compute hours delivered
- Quality score (based on work accuracy)
- Tier/rank (bronze → silver → gold → platinum)
- Visual appearance (upgrades for performance milestones)

#### What Cannot Change
- Token ID (permanent identifier)
- Original mint date
- Ownership history (public record)
- Core worker identity

## How the NFT System Works

### Minting Process (Creating New NFTs)

1. **Worker Registers**: AI worker completes onboarding
2. **Sentry Validates**: Off-chain system verifies hardware specs
3. **Admin Approves**: Authorized minter reviews application
4. **NFT Minted**: Contract creates new token
   - Assigns next available tokenId
   - Records owner address
   - Sets initial tokenURI
   - Emits `Transfer` event
5. **Metadata Generated**: Server creates JSON and image files
6. **NFT Active**: Worker can now accept compute jobs

### Viewing an NFT

1. **User Opens Wallet**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.
2. **Wallet Queries Contract**: "What's the tokenURI for NFT #123?"
3. **Contract Responds**: "https://nft.aipowergrid.io/metadata/123.json"
4. **Wallet Fetches JSON**: Downloads metadata from server
5. **Wallet Displays**: Shows image, name, and attributes

### Trading/Transferring NFTs

1. **Owner Lists NFT**: On OpenSea, Blur, or other marketplace
2. **Buyer Purchases**: Pays in ETH or other token
3. **Smart Contract Executes**: 
   - Verifies buyer payment
   - Transfers NFT ownership to buyer
   - Sends payment to seller
   - Records new owner on blockchain
4. **Worker Reassigned**: New owner controls the AI worker (future feature)

## NFT Utility in AIPG Network

### Current Utility

1. **Proof of Ownership**: NFT = ownership of AI worker node
2. **Performance Tracking**: View worker stats via NFT metadata
3. **Collectible Value**: Rare configurations (top-tier GPUs) more valuable
4. **Network Status**: Active NFT holders are network participants

### Planned Utility

1. **Revenue Rights**: NFT owners earn portion of worker's compute earnings
2. **Governance Voting**: NFT holders vote on network upgrades
3. **Staking Boosts**: Stake NFT + AIPG for bonus rewards
4. **Premium Features**: Access to advanced network features
5. **Fractional Ownership**: Split high-value worker NFTs into shares

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### Smart Contract Layer
```
GridNFT.sol (on Base blockchain)
├── ERC721 Standard (OpenZeppelin)
│   ├── _mint() - Create new NFT
│   ├── _transfer() - Move NFT between owners
│   └── tokenURI() - Get metadata link
├── Access Control
│   ├── MINTER_ROLE - Can create NFTs
│   └── DEFAULT_ADMIN - Manages roles
└── Metadata Management
    ├── baseURI - Base URL for all metadata
    └── tokenId → owner mapping
```

### Metadata Server
```
NFT Metadata Server (off-chain)
├── JSON Files
│   ├── /metadata/1.json
│   ├── /metadata/2.json
│   └── /metadata/N.json
├── Image Files
│   ├── /images/1.png
│   ├── /images/2.png
│   └── /images/N.png
└── Generation Scripts
    ├── trait-combiner.js - Mix visual elements
    ├── metadata-builder.js - Create JSON files
    └── stats-updater.js - Refresh dynamic data
```

### Integration Flow
```
Worker Performs Compute → Sentry Tracks Stats → Updates Metadata → NFT Reflects New Data
```

## NFT Generation Framework

The `nft-generation-framework.js` script handles automated NFT creation:

### Input Data
```javascript
{
  tokenId: 123,
  workerAddress: "0x1234...5678",
  gpuType: "RTX 4090",
  computePower: "82.58 TFLOPS",
  location: "North America",
  tier: "platinum"
}
```

### Generation Steps

1. **Load Templates**: Base image layers (background, frame, badges)
2. **Apply Traits**: Add GPU-specific graphics, location icons
3. **Add Performance Indicators**: Color overlays for tier (gold, silver, etc.)
4. **Composite Image**: Layer all elements using Canvas/Sharp
5. **Generate Metadata**: Create JSON with all attributes
6. **Upload to IPFS/Server**: Store image and JSON
7. **Update Contract**: Set tokenURI to point to metadata

### Visual Composition Example

```
Final NFT Image Layers (bottom to top):
├── Layer 1: Background (gradient based on tier)
├── Layer 2: Worker silhouette/icon
├── Layer 3: GPU model badge
├── Layer 4: Performance bars (uptime, compute power)
├── Layer 5: Location flag/icon
├── Layer 6: Frame/border (color = tier)
└── Layer 7: Token ID text overlay
```

## Security Considerations for NFTs

### On-Chain Security
- **Immutable Ownership**: Only owner can transfer their NFT
- **No Unauthorized Minting**: Only MINTER_ROLE can create NFTs
- **Standard Compliance**: ERC721 ensures compatibility and safety
- **Pausable**: Admin can freeze all transfers in emergency

### Off-Chain Security
- **Metadata Integrity**: IPFS or content-addressed storage prevents tampering
- **Image Hosting**: Redundant servers ensure availability
- **Access Control**: Only authorized systems can update dynamic data
- **Backup Systems**: Regular backups prevent data loss

### Attack Vectors
- **Metadata Manipulation**: Attacker changes JSON on server
  - Mitigation: Use IPFS (content-addressed, immutable)
- **Phishing**: Fake NFTs that look identical
  - Mitigation: Verify contract address before buying
- **Image Hosting Failure**: Server goes down, images disappear
  - Mitigation: Decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave)

## For Auditors: Key Review Points

### Smart Contract Review
1. **Minting Logic**: Can only authorized roles mint?
2. **Transfer Safety**: Are there any transfer restrictions?
3. **Metadata Updates**: Can baseURI be changed? By whom?
4. **Access Control**: Are role assignments secure?
5. **Upgrade Mechanism**: Is contract upgradeable?

### Metadata System Review
1. **URL Structure**: How are tokenURIs constructed?
2. **Centralization**: Is metadata stored centrally or decentralized?
3. **Update Mechanism**: How are dynamic traits updated?
4. **Backup/Recovery**: What if metadata server fails?

### Integration Review
1. **Worker Linking**: How is NFT ID linked to actual AI worker?
2. **Performance Tracking**: How are stats verified before NFT update?
3. **Ownership Transfer**: What happens to worker when NFT is sold?

## Example User Journey

### Alice Mints a GridNFT

1. Alice operates an AI worker with RTX 4090 GPU
2. She registers on AIPG network and passes validation
3. Admin mints GridNFT #456 to Alice's address
4. Server generates image with RTX 4090 badge, "Platinum" tier
5. Metadata JSON created with Alice's worker specs
6. NFT appears in Alice's MetaMask wallet

### Alice's Worker Performs Well

1. Worker runs 24/7 for 6 months with 99.9% uptime
2. Sentry tracks performance data continuously
3. Monthly update script refreshes NFT metadata
4. Uptime attribute changes: "95.2%" → "99.9%"
5. Tier upgrades: "Gold" → "Platinum"
6. Image regenerates with platinum border
7. NFT now shows updated performance in wallet

### Alice Sells Her NFT

1. Alice lists GridNFT #456 on OpenSea for 5 ETH
2. Bob sees the NFT has excellent stats and buys it
3. OpenSea contract transfers NFT to Bob
4. Bob now owns the NFT and (future) associated worker revenue rights
5. Worker continues operating under new ownership
6. All performance history preserved in NFT metadata

## Comparison: GridNFT vs Other NFTs

| Feature | GridNFT | Standard Art NFT | PFP NFT (Bored Ape) |
|---------|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Represent AI worker ownership | Digital art ownership | Profile picture + community |
| **Utility** | Earn from compute work | None (aesthetic only) | Community access, IP rights |
| **Dynamic** | Yes (stats update) | No (static image) | No (static image) |
| **Value Basis** | Worker performance | Artist reputation | Community/brand strength |
| **Real-World Link** | Tied to actual hardware | None | None |

## Conclusion

GridNFTs are **functional digital assets** that represent ownership and performance of real AI compute workers. Unlike purely collectible NFTs, they have measurable utility and value tied to network operations.

The system combines blockchain security (immutable ownership) with off-chain flexibility (updatable metadata) to create a dynamic representation of AI infrastructure participation.
