Extended Scope,Full ecosystem (2,350 lines),"Complete security coverage"
Audit Firm Quotes,$40K-$60K,Industry standard for contracts of this complexity
Grant Request,"75,000 OP ($56,250)",Covers comprehensive audit + follow-up
Security Features,Role-based access control + EIP-712 + Capped supply,Critical for production deployment
Post-Audit Impact,Enables safe TVL growth & DeFi integrations,Unlocks full ecosystem potential

KEY ASSUMPTIONS
Assumption,Conservative Estimate,Optimistic Estimate,Basis
Migration Adoption Rate (6mo),25%,40%,Similar Base migrations average 30-50%
Avg TVL per User,$300,$500,Base DeFi avg is $850
OP Price,$0.75,$1.00,Current market price used
User Retention,80%,90%,Sticky due to staking rewards
DeFi Integration Impact,2x TVL per user,3x TVL per user,Historical DeFi multiplier effect
Community Growth Rate,10% monthly,15% monthly,Current Discord/Twitter growth trends

RISK MITIGATION
Risk,Likelihood,Mitigation,Impact on TVL
Smart Contract Vulnerability,Low,Comprehensive audit by Nethermind,Critical - Prevents all TVL
Slow Migration Adoption,Medium,Active marketing + user incentives,Delays timeline by 1-2 months
OP Price Volatility,High,TVL calculated in USD equivalent,Cosmetic - doesn't affect user value
Competition from Other Bridges,Low,First-mover on Base for AIPG,Minimal - unique token migration
Regulatory Changes,Low,Decentralized infrastructure,Monitored - prepared to adapt

NOTES
- All projections use conservative $0.75/OP price
- TVL assumes 100% of migrated tokens remain staked/locked in DeFi
- User growth based on existing 20K holder base (per explorer data)
- Migration rate benchmarked against similar Base chain migrations
- Grant ROI calculated as 6-month TVL divided by grant amount
- Current bridge data shows 16 successful migrations averaging 11K AIPG each
- Community size verified across Discord (1.2K) + Twitter (3.5K) + Telegram (800)
- Smart contract audit scope: 2,350 lines (412 core + 1,938 extended ecosystem)
