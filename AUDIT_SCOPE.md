# Audit Scope & Priorities

## üéØ Audit Round 1 - Three Contracts

This audit focuses on **THREE contracts**:

### 1. AIPGTokenV2 (DEPLOYED)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED TO BASE MAINNET**  
**Address**: `0xa1c0deCaFE3E9Bf06A5F29B7015CD373a9854608`  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL - PRODUCTION CONTRACT**

This is our primary asset token contract currently live on Base Mainnet. This contract is the foundation of our bridge and token ecosystem.

### 2. EmissionsControllerV2 (PENDING DEPLOYMENT)

**Status**: üîµ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
**Priority**: **HIGH - DEPLOYMENT PENDING AUDIT**

This contract manages token emissions and distributes rewards to GPU workers. Will be deployed to Base Mainnet immediately after audit approval.

### 3. BondedWorkerRegistry (PENDING DEPLOYMENT)

**Status**: üîµ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
**Priority**: **HIGH - DEPLOYMENT PENDING AUDIT**

This contract manages bonded worker registration, staking, and slashing mechanisms. Workers stake AIPG tokens to participate in the network. Will be deployed to Base Mainnet immediately after audit approval.

   - `bridgeMint` function with EIP-712 signatures
   - UUID replay protection
   - Signature verification
   - Deadline enforcement
   
3. **Token Economics**
   - MAX_SUPPLY cap (150M tokens)
   - Mint/burn mechanics
   - Transfer restrictions (if any)
   
4. **Emergency Controls**
   - Pause/unpause functionality
   - Admin role transfer safety
   
5. **EIP-712 Implementation**
   - Domain separator correctness
   - Signature replay protection across chains

2. **Worker Reward Distribution**
   - EIP-712 signature verification for worker claims
   - Nonce-based replay protection
   - Deadline enforcement
   - Token minting via IAIPGToken interface
   
3. **Economic Model**
   - Era-based emission schedule (7 eras)
   - Reward splits: 60% workers, 30% stakers, 10% treasury
   - MAX_SUPPLY enforcement (150M tokens)
   - Reward per hour calculations
   
4. **Staking Integration**
   - IStakingVault interface calls
   - notifyRewardAmount() security
   - Handling zero/invalid vault address
   
5. **Emergency Controls**

   - Treasury/vault address updates
   
6. **EIP-712 Implementation**
   - WorkerClaim signature verification
   - Domain separator correctness
   - Nonce management

### Integration Requirements:
- Requires MINTER_ROLE on AIPGTokenV2
- Requires REWARD_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE on StakingVault (optional)
- Must interact securely with external contracts

4. **Worker Management**
   - Worker activation/deactivation
   - Model support registration
   - Worker ID to address mapping
   - Off-chain worker ID validation
   
5. **Economic Security**
   - Stake-to-reward ratio
   - Slashing penalties vs network security
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - Worker incentive alignment
   
6. **Token Handling**
   - Safe AIPG token transfers
   - Reentrancy protection on stake/unstake

## üìö Additional Contracts (For Reference Only)

**Status**: üü° **NOT PART OF THIS AUDIT**  
**Timeline**: Will be audited in future rounds

The following contracts are included in this repository for context and future audit rounds:

1. **GridNFT** - NFT contract for AI-generated art with on-chain parameters
2. **ModelRegistry** - Registry for AI models with constraints
3. **RecipeVault** - Storage for ComfyUI workflow templates
4. **StakingVault** - Token staking mechanism (needed by EmissionsController)

**These are for reference only and NOT part of Audit Round 1.**
